# Usage as a submodule
1. Add this repo as a submodule:

```
git submodule add git@github.com:nouseforkeys/advent-of-code-utils.git
```

2. Install locally as editable:

```
python -m pip install -e advent-of-code-utils/
```

# Improving the submodule

Just `cd` into `advent-of-code-utils/` and use `git` commands as normal. You'll see that branches, commits and other things are different when within that directory versus in the parent repo.
